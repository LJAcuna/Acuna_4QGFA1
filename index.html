        With our carbon dioxide emission putting us on a chokehold, it is our responsibility to mitigate the increasing air pollution all around us! 
        We can do this by creating sustainable technology and way of living in general. It is not realistic to just dump away our current technology though
        as the energy hungry economies of this planet needs something to accomodate to the flow of life here on Earth. Thus, investing in such sustainable technologies
        is a great way to help! The Clean Air Task Force (CATF) fulfills such plans through donations and innovations of experts and the massess to ensure our planet is being
        taken care off. Additionally, we must be able to reach a net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, which as of 2023, is just 28 years from now. Urgent action is
        necessary for us to achieve this. But such actions should also be efficient, shouldn't it? Therefore, the plans of the CATF will be fulfilled with 
        the use of our current understanding of our situation and the planet to create a world that uses green technology. Moreover, this sense of urgency quite forces
        organizations such as the CATF to ramp up their production when it comes to improving green technology innovation. That's why it is imperative to the CATF to 
        create policies and business models that cater to such urgency. Overall, efficient and innovative climate action with the use of scientific discoveries are the pillars 
        of the CATF.
